# Path-Stability-Mechanism-in-Mobility-by-Improved-AOMDV-for-MANETS

Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are used for providing Quality of Service (QoS) where nodes are having mobility and can travel in any random direction. There are several reactive protocols (DSDV, AODV, EBAODV, etc.) available in literatures which are suitable for MANETs based on single and multiple paths. Among these, AOMDV protocol is the most suitable for finding multiple paths to the destination. However, in its basic version does not consider mobility of intermediate nodes. In this work to enhance the path stability, mobility of an intermediate node and exclude the selection of high mobility node is introduced. Mobility of nodes is calculated by using RREQ packet retransmission strategy. The intermediate results are stored in routing table and this information is forwarded to source node for path selection process. Finally, intermediate node having least mobility is selected by the source for data packet transmission towards destination. For this we used AOMDV protocol with three different mobility models (Manhattan Grid, Random Walk, and Gauss Markov). All the models are investigated using network simulator and their comparisons are presented and found satisfactory
